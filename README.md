# Graph advanced algorithms tool
aalg-graphs is a Python program that implements graphs and advanced algorithms for approximation of betweenness centrality and average path length. Betweenness centrality is a measure of centrality in graphs that represents the extent to which a certain vertex lies on the shortest paths between other vertices. Average path length is the average of the lengths of the shortest path between every two vertices. For further details on how to use the tool, read the report.

## Warning!
This tool has not been tested (not even used) since 2020. It might light your computer on fire or spawn a greek god before your very eyes. It could also fix global warming or any other of humanity's problems. We totally don't know, so be prepared for a rough ride.

## Dependencies
[NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) must be installed.
